<p>GA2 or the Economic and Financial Committee is bounded and regulated by the principles  of Economics.  Ga2 follows a masterful and theoretical approach to debate as each delegate has to be aware of the global structure and anatomy and of how the markets work.  This committee would be utopia for those who replenish their souls by studying economics. Novices can also get a strong foothold by initiating their MUN endeavors in this committee.  Advice to all delegates is to be thoroughly prepared when it comes to dissecting a problem and implementing a complex solution.</p>

<p>The African Crisis Council is a committee set in years where the African continent rises from the shadows to attain the status of a global superpower through unexpected alliances and strategic negotiations. Being a committee based on time lapses and in depth situational reports, delegates are required to be think on their feet and strive towards attaining nothing but the best for his or her country. The FAU demands an advanced level of debate and exemplary diplomacy from all delegates. As head of state powers are provided within the committee, efficient resolution of hypothetical conflicts is beyond essential.  For all those daring enough to be a part of this first of its kind committee, good luck.</p>
