<p>The Economics and Social Council is bounded and regulated by the principles  of Economics.  ECOSOC follows a masterful and theoretical approach to debate as each delegate has to be aware of the global structure and anatomy and of how the markets work.  This committee would be utopia for those who replenish their souls by studying economics. Novices can also get a strong foothold by initiating their MUN endeavors in this committee.  Advice to all delegates is to be thoroughly prepared when it comes to dissecting a problem and implementing a complex solution.</p>
